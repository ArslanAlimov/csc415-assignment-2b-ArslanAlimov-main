* Description: 
*				we are basically creating a buffer that takes bytes and reads it off the file 
*				and gives it to our user 
*				it is similar to a server / user example - the user asks the server for some specifict bytes, and the server gives it to him
* 				till it has enough space in the buffer, else it will give a user 0 or whatever is leftout in the buffer.
